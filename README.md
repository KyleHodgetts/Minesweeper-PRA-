# Minesweeper-PRA-
A recreation of Minesweeper, my favourite game, using Java.

Launch Instructions:

1) Clone repository to your desired directory.

2) Enter the following command:
    cd Minesweeper-PRA-
    javac main/main.java
    java main/main

3) Play Minesweeper

How to play:

Left Click: Reveal the square. The number on the square indicates how many bombs are around it.

Right Click: Place a flag on that square, if you think that square is a bomb

Game ends when you click on a bomb (you lose) or you flag all bombs and reveal every other square that isn't a bomb.
